A complete simulation of our solar system made with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) with many features including:

- True to scale gravitational simulation of all bodies

- Simulated planetary rotation speeds

- Drawing orbital lines of bodies

- Manipulating orbits by changing masses

- High quality 3D models of all planets and moons from NASA

- Speed up the simulation by increasing substeps or timesteps

- Built-in scenario editor to create and save your own scenarios

### Installation

Download the newest binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/jan-tennert/Simulation) and run `Simulation.exe` to get started!

### Scenarios

You can load, edit and create scenarios within the application. A scenario is a collection of bodies with their initial positions, velocities, rotations and other properties.
