A complete simulation of our solar system made with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) with many features including:

- True to scale gravitational simulation of all bodies

- Simulated planetary rotation speeds

- Drawing orbital lines of bodies

- Manipulating orbits by changing masses

- High quality 3D models of all planets and moons from NASA

- Speed up the simulation by increasing substeps or timesteps
